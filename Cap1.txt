Introduction 
1. Aim of the document 
This is an introduction document for our project called "TorVergHub".

2. Overview of the defined system 
Our project, called "TorVergHub" is meant to be a support platform for students, in particular students from TorVergata university.
TorVergHub provides several functions useful for students like:
- sharing of didactic material (shared and ranked by user themselfs).
- a service of notifications for every professor's webpage.
- a platform for helping users in their working groups.
and other less important functions.

3. Operational settings 


4. Related systems (at least 2), Pros and Cons. 

a) YouMath.
YouMath is a website when users can ask questions about maths and they can read other users ' questions.
YouMath also provides solved exercises about a topic with a little explanation of the theorical aspect of that topic.

Unlike YouMath, our website provides several didactic materials (and not just one) for every topic.
Also every didactic material in our website is ranked by users, so a user can choose a didactic material among the others.

Another difference is that every user from high school or university can use YouMath while our website is specifically designed for TorVergata's students.
This means that YouMath is very generic (it has few materials for a lot of topics).
On the other hand our website is very specific (it has several materials, but for topics related to our courses only).

In the end, our website provides other functions, YouMath does not.

b) MISSING
